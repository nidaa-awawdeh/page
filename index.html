            <h3>Sample II</h3>


            Hello, I Atheer Abu Rayan
            I have a motor disability, and I use my tongue sometimes to open my phone, which exposes me to criticism or
            sympathy at
            my university. I study social work at Al-Quds Open University
            I have ambitions to join the stage of change in the world towards the issues of people with disabilities,
            and to end the
            problem of bullying
            I am not satisfied with the abuse that occurs to any disabled person in the world.
            Specifically, I am not satisfied with public places that are not considered eligible for all the disabled,
            and I am
            dissatisfied with the penal code for those who abuse the disabled
            Unfortunately, my disability caused me to receive many negative attitudes silently, so the idea of
            ​​integrating
            technology with culture to help the disabled is important.
